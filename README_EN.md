# VMFive MAN - JavaScript SDK Integration Guide

[Quickstart](https://github.com/VMFive/vmfive-man-web-demo/blob/gh-pages/README_EN.md#quickstart)

[DFP Support](https://github.com/VMFive/vmfive-man-web-demo/blob/gh-pages/README_EN.md#google-dfp-support)

## Quickstart

### Insert Main Entry Point

To add an Ad Unit to the page, first include the main SDK entry point in the `<body>` section of the page:

```html
<script id="vm5ad-js-sdk" src="https://vawpro.vm5apis.com/man.js" data-mode="fast"></script>
<script>
  window.onVM5AdSDKReady = function() {
    VM5AdSDK.init({ appKey: '580db14a4a801a2674a56f81' });
  };
</script>
<script src="https://man.vm5apis.com/dist/adn-web-sdk.js"></script>
```

Some key elements here that you need to change according to your account information:

1. Make sure the script element's ID is `vm5ad-js-sdk` and its `data-mode` attribute is set to `fast`.
2. Replace `appKey` value with your valid app key.

### Insert Ad Unit

Then, at the location where you want the Ad Unit to appear, insert the following `vmfive-ad-unit` element:

```html
<vmfive-ad-unit placement-id="582ad449038f454a190d4331" ad-type="video-native"></vmfive-ad-unit>
```

Again, things that needed to be changed according to your account information:

1. `placement-id`
2. `ad-type`



And that's all! You should able to see your Ad Unit appearing on your page at the location you specified.



## Google DFP Support

VMFive MAN JavaScript SDK fully supports serving from Google DFP. The integration steps for DFP creatives are a little bit different than above.

### DFP Creative

Create a creative with the following code:

```html
<script id="vm5ad-js-sdk" src="https://vawpro.vm5apis.com/man.js" data-mode="dfp-creative"></script>
<script>
window.onVM5AdDFPCreativeReady = function() {
  VM5AdDFP.register({
    appKey: '580db14a4a801a2674a56f81',
    placementId: '582ad449038f454a190d4331',
    adType: 'video-native',
    clickUrl: '%%CLICK_URL_UNESC%%',
    width: %%WIDTH%%,
    height: %%HEIGHT%%,
    slotId: 'vm5-dfp-hello'
  });
};
</script>
```

Since the SDK will get all the parameters from the creative, you need to change all of the parameters passed to the `register` method according to your account information. And most importantly, the `slotId` is the slot id generated by the tag generator.

### Insert Main Entry Point

On the page where the ad is served, insert the following tag in the `<head>` section:

```html
<script id="vm5ad-js-sdk" src="https://vawpro.vm5apis.com/man.js" data-mode="dfp"></script>
```

**IMPORTANT: Please note that this line must be inserted *before* any Google DFP or GPT tags** so that the trigger listener can be initialized before DFP activate the trigger.
